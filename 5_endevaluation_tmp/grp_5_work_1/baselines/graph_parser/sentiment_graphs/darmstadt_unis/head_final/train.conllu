# text = Likes : - On hands training ( a lot of lab work ) - Some very knowledgeable experts were my professors ( this matters because you learn best from those who have real world knowledge , and not just from an individual with a masters or phd and no real world experience ; and yes more of my professors had obtained their phds ) - very good guidance and counseling on what courses will be required and what courses mesh well with certain other courses taken during the semester Dislikes : - expensive as hell , at least for a tech school - the university has more of a business approach ; rather , than a campus to serve the students approach - too many units in one semester ( if you are on the accelerated program ) - you don't get the same atmosphere as other universities ie . parties , sports teams , or hot chicks ( lets face it hot girls don't want to become engineers ) From my experience during my attendance at DeVry , I noticed only two types of students ; those who want a piece of paper that states they are engineers , and those who actually strive at becoming engineers because they know their future livelihood will depend on it .
